				I've been working with computers for over a decade.
				Ranging from networks to small website development.
				I specialize in Virtualization and Windows Servers.
				I'm familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
				I'm currently learning Ruby and Rails. 
				You can find me playing basketball or video games when I'm not working with computers.
				I'm very passionate about computers and I want to know everything there is to know about them.
